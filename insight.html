<h1>On being kind</h1>

<body>
    Since Omar has met many physicians and scientists, I asked him what he thought about "being kind." 
    As ego, arrogance, and competitiveness often mark top doctors and researchers alike, I was curious what his 
    opinions were. Rewording a bit, his answer was that those who are truly strong will always be kind, as they 
    know they have nothing to lose by helping others. It is only those that are fearful and unsure of their 
    own place that will be unkind. Therefore, always be kind.  
    
    <br> It is for this reason that I hope, in the coming years, that I may focus on being kind.
