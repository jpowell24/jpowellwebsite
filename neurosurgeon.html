<h1>Why neurosurgery?</h1>

<body>
    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> The basis of the medical field is solving problems that immediately improve someone's quality of life. 
        <li> Neurosurgeon is preferred over neurology due to the directness of help provided. 
        <ul>
            <li> Solving a problem with your own hands is more enticing to me than the iterative process of perscribing medications.               
            <li> I am less interested in diagnosing patients, reading charts, etc., and more interested in providing needed help with relative immediacy. 
        </ul>
        <li> The brain is everything. It is your memories, your personality, your creativity, consciousness, etc. 
        <ul>
            <li> While many body systems are fascinating in their own right, the brain holds a mystic that demands lifelong attention. 
        </ul>
        <li> Neurosurgery, in particular, also seems to have the largest variety of solvable problems. 
        <ul>
            <li> For example: one may treat Parkinson's disease surgically using <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31291491/"> focused ultrasound </a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002606/"> deep brain stimulation </a>. 
            <li> Who would have thought a degenartive disease could be treated further ablating neurons?
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2> Why research in addition to surgery? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> "Neurosurgery is the quickest specialty to use next generation equipment, and research is the only way to move the field forward." - Dr. Shih-Shan Lang Chen
        <li> Staying up to date and contributing to research makes you a better doctor, and corollary, a better researcher.
        <ul>
            <li> A surgeon will inherently have a better grasp on the technologies lacked in the field.
        </ul>
        <li> By design, medicine is becoming more about "following estabished protocols" as closely as possible---boring!
        <ul>
            <li> As time goes on, protocols get stricter and there becomes less and less room for "outside the box thinking."
            <li> Research provides a creative outlet outside of the operating room to keep the mind strong!
        </ul>
    </ul>
