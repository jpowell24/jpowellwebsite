<h1>Why code?</h1>

<body>

    <p> Sometimes people ask me why I am interested in programming, if I am pursuing a career as a neurosurgeon. 
        It is probably worth stating explicitly why this is a worthwhile endeavor. Firstly, the most obvious 
        place for a programmer in medicine is the ability to briskly analyze patient data. This has not been my
        area, though, as someone more equipped with machine learning knowledge is better suited for this. Though, 
        it remains a possibility in the future. Secondly, one can easily imagine needing to do cost-benefit 
        analysis of new surgeries/treatments. That is, analysis of percieved patient benefit as a function of 
        economic cost. It is not uncommon for treatments to have very low, but non-negligible health benefit. 
        But, does this make it feasible? One can write a program to see. Thirdly, that which is more relevant to
        me, is that one can probe the landscape of possibilities for therapeutics, and similarly simulate them. 
        An example may be: Perhaps you are interested in using high intensity focused ultrasound to ablate a 
        part of the brain that is overstimulated in severe cases OCD. You are worried about the side effects, 
        particularly in regions of the brain bordering the targeted area. Suppose the factors you are interested 
        in, but have no way to measure directly, are both the immediate thermal affects, and the long term 
        diffusion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the area following the treatment. One can thus model the 
        propagation of heat or ROS and analyze the propensity to damage nearby neurons without having to do 
        extensive testing. Thus, computational modeling serves as a powerful precursor for testing the efficacy, 
        and potential side effects, of therapeutics. As a final comment: it is inevitable that medicine will 
        become dominated by robotics over time. Consequently, it is inevitable that those interested in perfecting
        the electronics will have to have both a good concept of medicine and computer programming. As such, I 
        will be prepared in both.
